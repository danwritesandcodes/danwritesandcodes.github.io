Dan White • Santa Clara, CA 95050

# Overview

My name is Dan White and I love to write and code. I have ten years of experience as a Staff Technical Writer at Synopsys where I produce documentation for the flagship Fusion Compiler product. My validation utilities raise the quality of documentation for the company by catching syntax, style, and consistency errors before publication.

# Experience

## Senior Technical Writer • Argo AI

*Documentation*: Created user guides and developer-facing documentation for the components of the autonomous vehicle.

*Application Development*: Developed utilities to improve the quality and consistency of Argo AI's documetation using Markdown, Google Doc, and Confluence.

## Staff Technical Writer • Synopsys • 2010-2020

*Documentation*: Developed user guides, application notes, labs, man pages, and other materials for the company's flagship Fusion Compiler product.

*Application Development*: Developed validation utilities in Java, Go, and Python to enforce consistent formatting, command, and style guide adherence across user guides and man pages for Fusion Compiler. Some utilities caught the attention of writers in other divisions and were adopted to improve their documentation.

*Leadership*: Authored and conducted usability studies to better understand document effectiveness and to provide ideas for improvement. Hired, supervised, and mentored summer interns to develop a concordance builder, a man page example test framework, and a Markdown-to-FrameMaker XML document creation flow.

## Writing

The following are some writing samples:

*Connection Assessment*: This writing sample represents a very heavily modified topic from the user guide I've worked on most recently. I develop this type of content by working closely with R&D, running the tool to reproduce and verify the results, and create screen captures and snippets for scripts. HTML PDF

*Python Excels*: This is a series of blog posts I first created in 2009 and revised in 2019. These posts demonstrate various techniques for automating common tasks in Microsoft Excel with Python. I originally hosted Python Excels on a custom Wordpress site, but recently migrated everything using a docs-as-code approach with Markdown files hosted on Github. pythonexcels.com Github

*Other*: I have many more writing samples, please contact me if you need to see more.

## Coding

The following are some coding examples:

*Java*: The SSSCheck application performs a comprehensive document check for syntax, style guide, and spelling errors. This code represents a small fraction of an actual application I wrote for our team to identify hard-to-find errors and increase document quality. Wiki Code

*Go*: This is a simple API server I developed to learn and experiment with API documentation. The API server, written in the Go language, provides a few endpoints that access an SQL database. The database contains the Cars93 database with 93 records for different 1993 model cars. Swagger documentation Code

*Python*: The Python scripts for the Python Excels blog are available on GitHub at https://github.com/pythonexcels/examples.

*Javascript*: This is a companion front-end application for the Cars93 API server. I developed this application to learn more about how APIs are consumed and how API documentation could be used by developers. HTML Github.
